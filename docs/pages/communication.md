You have configured and deployed your Dataspace Connector as described [here](deployment.md)? Then 
check out our step-by-step guide to see the Connector in action.

To interact with the running application, the provided 
[endpoints](deployment/build.md#maven) can be used - either automated by an application or manually 
by interacting with the Swagger UI. In this section, it is explained how to provide local and remote 
data with a connector and how to consume this from another one.

**Note**: The Dataspace Connector's repository comes with a `scripts/tests` folder that provides
some Python scripts. They contain the creation of a full data offering and its consumption by a
consumer: for a single resource with a single usage policy, a single resource with multiple usage
policies, and providing and requesting multiple artifacts at once.
